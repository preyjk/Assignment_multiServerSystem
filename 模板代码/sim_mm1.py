COMP9334 Capacity Planning

This Python file simulates an M/M/1 queue with mean arrival rate 
lambda and service rate mu

It outputs the mean response time 

There are 3 simulation parameters:
1. Arrival rate lambda
2. Service rate mu
3. Simulation time time_end

# Events
###########################
#
# There are two events: An arrival event and a departure event
#
# An arrival event is specified by
#   next_arrival_time = the time at which the next customer arrives
#   service_time_next_arrival = the service time of the next arrival
#
# A departure event is specified by
#   next_departure_time = the time at which the next departure occurs
#   arrival_time_next_departure = the time at which the next departing
#               customer arrives at the system

# buffer_content
# 
# server_status = 1 if busy, 0 if idle
# 
# queue_length is the number of customers in the buffer
# 
# buffer_content is a list-of-lists
# 
# The inner lists are lists with 2 elements. 
# The elements contain the arrival time and service time of a customer.
# 
# E.g. If buffer_contents = [[5,7],[8,4]] means there are 2 customers
# in the server. 
# For the 1st customer, its arrival and service times are respectively 5 and 7. 
# For the 2nd customer, its arrival and service times are respectively 8 and 4.
#
# To add a job to the end of the buffer, use buffer_contents.append()
# To take a job off the front of the buffer, use buffer_contents.pop(0)
